# capstone-class-enrollment
This is my capstone project for Android Developer nanodegree program by Udacity. This app helps students of a dance school to enroll in classes online.
I implemented login and register features using Firebase auth and Firebase realtime db. This app also has a home widget that displays list of enrolled classes for a student.
The data is fetched from Firebase realtime db and is displayed in the widget listview.
